```lrc
[00:24.02] When I look back
[00:25.49] That's when I see everything was wrong
[00:27.33] And you looked sad
[00:28.92] That's when I said I'd write you a song
[00:48.42] 
[00:30.87] Everybody's got their reasons
[00:32.69] Everybody's got their ghosts to fear
[00:34.40] When I look back
[00:42.40] 
[00:35.41] All I see is I've done something wrong, wrong
[00:38.32] All I see is I've done something wrong, wrong
[00:42.32] All I see is I've done something wrong
[01:01.32] 
[00:57.90] Oh my dear, my tis of thee
[00:59.79] What a tangled web we weave
[01:01.76] Everyone is the one until the one falls down
[01:03.66] Then we're all just please, please, please
[01:24.66] 
[01:05.14] The painted rust will only
[01:06.91] Fool the fools for just so long
[01:08.67] Eventually
[01:13.67] 
[01:09.71] That's when they'll see everything was wrong, wrong
[01:13.03] That's when they'll see everything was wrong, wrong
[01:16.55] That's when they'll see everything was wrong
[01:38.55] 
[01:45.54] So here's to the boys who fight all the wars
[01:49.21] You will never fight for yourself
[01:52.65] And you can ignore whoever you want to
[01:56.48] But in the end
[02:03.48] 
[01:59.73] Oh, the shame, humility
[02:01.66] What a wicked gang are we
[02:03.55] Like a liar looking down on a thief
[02:04.79] Looking down on a killer, looking down on a creep
[02:29.29] 
[02:06.52] Oh, this sinking ship will only
[02:08.36] Hold its course for just so long
[02:10.67] Eventually
[02:15.67] 
[02:11.55] That's when they'll see everything is wrong, wrong
[02:15.16] That's when they'll see everything is wrong, wrong
[02:18.60] That's when they'll see everything is wrong
